<details><summary><strong>CME Company Reports Massive Data Breach- SOC Has Little To No Understanding Why</strong></summary>
  <span>Date: 12/1/19</span>
  <p>Acme company, a medium sized manufacturing firm from Colorado Springs, announced today that they had been the victim of a large data breach.  The company is a manufacturer of smart phone cases- and has many first to market contracts with various manufacturers of devices (Apple, Samsung, HTC, etc.) Due to their business model, it is imperative that they have a tight knit security stance.  The company holds some of these device manufacturers intellectual property on new phone models- including size, buttons, camera placement and more. We can all see why this is important to secure so that imitator cases, or even devices don’t get released on market first. Unfortunately for ACME, it looks like the 3rd party SOC has dropped the ball completely. Hackerman News has tried to glean as much information as possible- but neither the SOC or Company were willing to comment on the nature of the data loss- nor in a position to with the information they had.    Hackerman News will be the first to update you on the cause of the data loss, as well as any changes the company plans to make.</p>

<details><summary><strong>ACME Company Responds to Data Breach- Hires New CISO after E. Frudd Quits</strong></summary>
  <span>Date: 12/3/19</span>
  <p>ACME company has been through the ringer, and the news won’t let up this week.  In a shocking move, Elmer Fudd, the former CISO quit suddenly after the breach was discovered.  When asked to comment- an unnamed source said “It could have been because of his gross level of negligence, to the point of warranting impending litigation.” To their credit the company responded, and hired a new CISO within a few days.  Wiley E Coyote has a proven track record of success- often during stress, and many high esteemed industry insiders have even hailed him as a “genius.” When asked to comment, he simply said: “I will make changes immediately to bring the company to the standards of myself, and  our industry partners.”  Hopefully this fresh mind will prove himself to the industry, and his customers alike.  The company depends on it. Hackerman News will continue to report as this story evolves. </p>

<details><summary><strong>Fresh ACME CISO Fires Out of House Security Operations Center</strong></summary>
  <span>Date: 12/6/19</span>
  <p>In another exclusive article we delve into ACME’s recent data breach, and a solution the new CISO has posed .  The new ACME CISO, Wiley E Coyote, fired the outsourced security company: Cyber Security Stooges.  Maybe as their namesake suggests- they don’t take their job as seriously as they should.  The company was the single point of failure for the breach, and directly managed by E. Frudd. The now disgraced CISO, Frudd was not available to comment on the recent breach. Although unwilling to comment on the cause of managerial failure, and lack of a swift response, Coyote said “While I regret the decisions made by my predecessor, I am not willing to comment on any reasons he may have left, or the cause of the breach.  While it’s unfortunate we stopped doing business with Cyber Security Stooges, we are currently looking into a way to immediately implement an appropriate in house Security Operations Center.”  Hopefully the solution is found quickly, otherwise the confidence of many of ACME’s partners is at stake.  </p>

<details><summary><strong>Cyber Security Stooges Responds to the ACME Breach</strong></summary>
  <span>Date: 12/7/19</span>
  <p>We have a unique take on the ACME crisis this week, provided to us by the SOC who had ACME as an account. Cyber Security Stooges are a small, but growing Security Operations Center who had ACME as one of their accounts for 3 years. They immediately reached out after our article, and asked that we explain their side, so of course we obliged.  When asked about their name Moe jokes “We do take Cyber Security very seriously, but our names are Moe, Larry, and Curley, so it fit!” They explained “This was as far as we were able to investigate- a zero day vulnerability. We shouldn’t be under any scrutiny, there was nothing we could do.” Larry spoke positively of Frudd, saying “I always thought he had his head on straight for security. The plans we implemented seemed to be fault-proof, so we had little communication with him.”  While Larry’s statement gives a bit more of a complete picture of the state of their security model, the idea of “fault proof” security with “little communication” gives us reason for concern.  It looks like we’ll see in the incoming few days how this all pans out. Coyote has been more than transparent with media, and Hackerman News is excited to see what changes are implemented.</p>

<details><summary><strong>ACME CISO Unveils In House SOC</strong></summary>
  <span>Date: 12/11/19</span>
  <p>In a busy news cycle surrounding the ACME breach, Hackerman News is eager to announce that today ACME CISO, Wiley E Coyote, has announced the creation an in house Security Operations Center.  He said that is was a multifaceted organization, minimizing one point of failure. “We have a security team in place working on a system that will allow us to conduct business with high levels of confidence in our security.”  We hope that the new team will settle into their roles quickly, and continue to report on the nature of the breach, as well as the future of the company.  ACME has to prove themselves in the next few weeks- the public, as well as industry partners are demanding it. </p>

<details><summary><strong>Another ACME Update: Coyote Hires Road Runner Corporation</strong></summary>
  <span>Date: 12/11/19</span>
  <p>In another up to the minute update, ACME announced that it would also be working with Road Runner Corporation, a well known consulting group.  The consulting group is known to be efficient, especially working under pressure, which highlights Coyote’s strengths.  Coyote announced “The ability to use Road Runner Corp. as a consultant will benefit our SOC greatly.”  Their per diem rates make it so that problems are still able to be tackled in a cost effective way- while being able to use them as little as an organization needs.  Hackerman news is excited to see how ACME’s Buford T. Justice SOC, coupled with the consulting of Road Runner corporation handles this breach.  Hopefully they show the company the direction it needs desperately right now. </p>
